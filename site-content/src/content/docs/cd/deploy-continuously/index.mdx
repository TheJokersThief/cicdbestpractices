title: Deploy Continuously
---

There’s a good reason the word continuous is in Continuous Delivery. **Deploying 
every time you merge to your mainline branch has a tonne of advantages over doing
a timed release every week/month.**

> Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are 
> automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of modern application 
> development, continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying 
> all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after 
> the build stage. When properly implemented, developers will always have a 
> deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.

## The benefits

### Reduce risk
Firstly, it reduces the risk of any particular deployment by making debugging 
easier. Having one changeset to analyse makes it a lot easier to identify what’s 
gone wrong, and find the most appropriate person to fix it (i.e. the commit author). 

### Improve the feedback loop
Secondly, it reduces the feedback loop for changes. Folks get to see their 
changes go out quickly, and it makes iteration easier. The shorter the feedback 
loop, the easier it is to make sure your changes work with all the others.

### Deliver features quicker
Thirdly, everyone gets features quicker. Your customers won’t have to wait for 
the next release cycle, they’ll get the feature as soon as it’s ready.

### Google's DevOps Research & Analysis (DORA) metrics<sup>[1]</sup>
At a high level, **Deployment Frequency** and **Lead Time for Changes** measure 
velocity, while **Change Failure Rate** and **Time to Restore Service** measure 
stability. And by measuring these values, and continuously iterating to improve 
on them, a team can achieve significantly better business outcomes.

DORA identified that teams that deployed on-demand, multiple times a day, were
in their "elite" category. Elite teams were twice as likely to meet or exceed 
their organizational performance goals.

### The business value of Continuous Delivery by atlassian<sup>[2]</sup>
Atlassian's article about continuous delivery describes it in terms that will be
more familiar to business-minded folks. They state that the overall benefits of 
deploying continuously are:

1. Velocity – Automated software delivery pipelines help organizations respond 
to market changes better. 
1. Producitivity – Productivity increases when tedious and repetitive tasks, can 
be performed by pipelines instead of humans. 
1. Sustainability – Automated pipelines reduce manual labor and lead to eventual 
savings since personnel is more expensive than tools.
