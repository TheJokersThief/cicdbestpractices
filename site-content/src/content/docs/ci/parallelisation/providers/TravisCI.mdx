* [Parallelizing your builds across Virtual Machines](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/#parallelizing-your-builds-across-virtual-machines)

Say you want to split up your unit tests and your integration tests into two different build jobs. They’ll run in parallel and fully utilize the available build capacity for your account.

Here’s an example on how to utilize this feature in your .travis.yml:

```yaml
env:
  - TEST_SUITE=units
  - TEST_SUITE=integration
```

Then you change your script command to use the new environment variable to determine the script to run.

```
script: "bundle exec rake test:$TEST_SUITE"
```

Travis CI will determine the build matrix based on the environment variables and schedule two builds to run.
