To run a set of concurrent jobs, you will need to add a workflows section to your existing .circleci/config.yml file.

The simple example below shows the default workflow orchestration with two concurrent jobs. The workflows key needs to have a unique name. In this example, the unique name is build_and_test. The jobs key is nested under the uniquely named workflow, and contains the list of job names. Since the jobs have no dependencies, they will run concurrently.


```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/<language>:<version TAG>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/<language>:<version TAG>
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: <command>
workflows:
  build_and_test:
    jobs:
      - build
      - test
```
