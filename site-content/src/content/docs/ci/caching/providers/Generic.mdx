* [Caching plugin originally built for Drone CI](https://github.com/meltwater/drone-cache)
    * [Full list of CLI arguments and environment variables](https://github.com/meltwater/drone-cache#using-executable-with-cli-args)

To do this generically, we're going to leverage a public plugin for DroneCI and
hijack its inputs a little. Below, we'll detail the docker command that runs
this cache, to give you a picture of the common inputs.

To run this verbatim, delete the blank lines and comments.

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v "$(pwd)":/app \
    -e DRONE_REPO=octocat/hello-world \
    -e DRONE_REPO_BRANCH=main \
    -e DRONE_COMMIT_BRANCH=main \
    
    # restore = cache download 
    -e PLUGIN_RESTORE=false \
    # rebuild = cache upload
    -e PLUGIN_REBUILD=true \
 
    # Cloud storage location and authentication
    -e PLUGIN_BUCKET=<bucket> \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<token> \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret> \
 
    # To prevent partial cache unpacking, use `gzip` or `zstd` 
    -e PLUGIN_ARCHIVE_FORMAT="zstd"
 
    # A comma-separated list of directories to cache
    -e PLUGIN_MOUNT=/app/node_modules \
 
    # A Go-templated string to represent the cache key
    -e PLUGIN_CACHE_KEY='{{ .Commit.Branch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}-v1' \
    meltwater/drone-cache
```
