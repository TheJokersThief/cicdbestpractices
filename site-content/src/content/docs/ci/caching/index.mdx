**Caching is transient/temporary data storage.** It's the act of reusing previously 
made assets/artifacts/information to speed up your build by working from a 
previous checkpoint. By doing this, we can reduce redundant actions and improve 
computation speed.

### Benefits of caching

There are two primary benefits of caching:

1. **Build Speed:** By working from previous data, we don't have to repeat actions like
downloading dependencies or testing code that hasn't changed.
2. **Network Load Management:** A lot of modern CI processes use data from _somewhere_
else, such as downloading dependencies. By caching these actions, you don't just
reduce the time those actions take, but also the load they create on the external
services.

### What is a cache key?

**A cache key is the identifier for our cache**, and is how we will refer to and
extract data later. 

We often use dynamic information in our cache keys. For example, some folks will
choose to include the branch name so that every feature branch has a separate
cache.

A very common piece of dynamic information is a "checksum" of a file. A checksum
is a computed hash that represents the contents of a file. It's one-way, meaning
that you can generate a checksum from a file but you cannot generate that same file
from the checksum. This info is useful, to create a compact identifier that
represents a file's contents. When the contents change, so does the checksum.

## Popular Patterns

There is no one-size-fits-all pattern, and we'd encourage you to mix and match
patterns depending on what suits your needs.

### Update on the mainline only

Only rebuild/update/upload the cache on the master/main/release branch.

**Cache key example:**

```
<static-branch-name>-<checksum>-<static-version>
main-1234567890asdfghjkl-v1
```

**Pro:** Easy to share cache with all builds, because it's based on what's been merged
into the mainline.

**Con:** Testing caching can be hard as you have to remove any branch restrictions
for the cache update, and be careful to use a separate cache key so that you
don't affect anyone else's build. That is, you need to make manual changes that
should not be commit to the final product.

### Separate branch, separate cache

Each branch maintains a separate cache, that isn't shared with any other branches.

**Cache key example:**

```
<branch>-<checksum>-<static-version>
my-feature/ticket-123-1234567890asdfghjkl-v1
```

**Pro:** Easy to test caching changes.

**Con:** The first build on every new branch will take longer as it doesn't benefit 
from a cache.

### A cache per build, to share information

Every build/commit gets a separate cache, and doesn't share it outside the build.
This pattern is primarily used to pass information between different stages in
a build, such as unique build assets. 

**Cache key example:**

```
<commit-sha>-<checksum>-<static-version>
ae23bc1-1234567890asdfghjkl-v1
```

**Pro:** Can share information between machines and network locations.

**Con:** No data is shared with any other build/commit and so it doesn't contribute to
any speedup in subsequent builds.

## Advice 
### Picking a cache key

When choosing a cache key, you'll (generally) want a combination of three components:

1. **A description:** Something that describes the intended use of the cache (e.g. `npm-dependencies`)
2. **A checksum:** Often, we're storing the output of some process. A good cache
key includes the identifier for the inputs used to generate that output. For example,
the checksum of a lockfile (e.g. `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`) represents
the _inputs_ of the dependencies we downloaded/_output_.
3. **A static version:** Caches are not infallible, and sometimes we can end up
with a corrupted or somehow bad cache. To burst it and start over, it's useful to
have something like `-v1` at the end of they key to quickly burst the cache with
a single commit.
